### Day 1: January 3, 2018 (PracTimer)

**Today's Progress**: Now I have some functionality going with the JS. Tweaked the CSS some, created repo, etc.

**Thoughts:** I have the old JS commented next to the new. It'd be interesting to see the differences between how I did it before and now. 

Need to get the beeps in as well.

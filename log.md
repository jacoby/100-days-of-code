# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Added to make the Markdown Linter happy

### Day 0: January 2, 2019 (PracTimer)

**Today's Progress**: Worked out keyboard and swipe UI for PWA version of PT

**Thoughts:** Went easy.

### Day 1: January 3, 2019 (PracTimer)

**Today's Progress**: Now I have some functionality going with the JS. Tweaked the CSS some, created repo, etc.

**Thoughts:** I have the old JS commented next to the new. It'd be interesting to see the differences between how I did it before and now.

Need to get the beeps in as well.

### Day 2: January 4, 2019 (PracTimer)

**Today's Progress**: Got the HTML5Audio Beeps going again.

**Thoughts:** A problem is that there are points where the interval _should_ be stopped and deleted, but that gets ignored. This is not good. Maybe should test cross-platform, but if Chrome does it, _a lot_ of browsers will do it as well.

### Day 3: January 5, 2019 (PracTimer)

**Today's Progress**: UI simplified: removed keyboard controls, tap does start/stop. Changed the landscape CSS a little to make the font larger.

**Thoughts:** This was not the most productive. I like all the changes, but there was a lot more "What is the change that is needed?" than coding those changes.

### Day 4: January 06, 2019 (DayLog)

**Today's Progress**: I took it from new repo to program with POD and --help

**Thoughts:** I am happy with this. It relies on a LOT of previous experience I have with Perl.

### Day 5: January 07, 2019 (Fimble)

**Today's Progress**: Minimal. Hit well-trod ground (although using a static site for the callback is new and interesting) but I am no closer to a tool I do not have to hover over

**Thoughts:** The FitBit OAuth 2.0 API continues to frustrate me, but once I have consistent tokens, the rest is just curl and such.

### Day 6: January 08, 2019 (Blog)

**Today's Progress**: Played with Dice and Levenshtein and blogged on it

**Thoughts:** There's something to the Dice Coefficient, but it isn't, as advertised, 'better than Levenshtein'.

### Day 7: January 9, 2019 (Blog)

**Today's Progress**: Wrote code dealing with FitBit

**Thoughts:** Was too tired with a too-busy day to finish up on this, but I did it

### Day 8: January 10, 2019 (Blog)

**Today's Progress**: Blogged on code dealing with FitBit

**Thoughts:** Telling people about it is almost as important, and I discovered some aspects about FitBit token management that I will want to integrate into my tooling and put in Finble

### Day 9: January 12, 2019 (Fimble)

**Today's Progress**: Alarm Tools

**Thoughts:** Need to toolify this and perhaps make it into a CPAN-ready tool.

### Day 10: January 13, 2019 (CanvasArt)

**Today's Progress**: Played with an idea. Did not get far/

**Thoughts:** Really need to learn SVG in HTML5 soon

### Day 11: January 13, 2019 (CanvasArt)

**Today's Progress**: Made a very psychedelic thing with dots

**Thoughts:** I need to convert to SVG

### Day 12: January 15, 2019 (Guitr)

**Today's Progress**: Played some with JSON to try to move it to more modern style

**Thoughts:** MAN I have learned a lot. And forgotten a lot

### Day 12: January 15, 2019 (Fimble)

**Today's Progress**: Added POD to my FitBit Alarm adder

**Thoughts:** POD is Good

### Day 13: January 16, 2019 (Fimble)

**Today's Progress**: Added a pull for sleep, which will eventually dump into the DB.

**Thoughts:** Had minor goofiness working through the API at first. Starting to consider the lib.

### Day 14: January 17, 2019 (Fimble)

**Today's Progress**: Started with logging water

**Thoughts:** Always remember to check to see if your dinguses work before testing, because you cannot tell if the issue is your code or your token.
